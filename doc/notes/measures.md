## Facilitate publishing
- Allows publishig of any document related to your research, with a DOI. https://figshare.com
- Open Science Framework. Facilitates collaboration by integrating with the workflow, allowing version control, sharing within and across labs, document and archive materials and data, decide what to publish. Credits individual contributions. https://osf.io
- Zenodo http://about.zenodo.org "Zenodo helps researchers receive credit by making the research results citable and through OpenAIRE integrates them into existing reporting lines to funding agencies like the European Commission. Citation information is also passed to DataCite and onto the scholarly aggregators."
- PLOS publishes Open Access journals https://www.plos.org/ "No restrictions on pages, figures or datasets needed to support your conclusions. With PLOS, you determine the length and number of figures in your published article, not us."
- http://arXiv.org (formerly xxx.lanl.gov) is a highly-automated electronic archive and distribution server for research articles.

## Self-correction
- Self-correction in science at work http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1420.full Incentives for quality > quantity. Incentives for correction/withdrawal > retraction. Increase clarity and quality of editorial response in peer-review: share comments between reviewers and collaborate on a response to the author with the editorial decision (used by eLife), cross-review where reviews are exchanged bwetween reviewers allows editors to capture input on reviews before returning them to authors (Science). Timely, unbiased investigation of allegations of misconduct/fraud. "Adopting more neutral language such as “disclosure of relevant relationships” [instead of "conflict of interest"] may encourage more complete compliance without implying that all disclosed associations are sinister."
