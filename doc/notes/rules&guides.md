## Misconceptions
- Harvey J. Motulsky (2014) "Common Misconceptions about Data Analysis and Statistics" http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/351/1/200 "investigators often make these mistakes: 1) P-hacking, which is when you reanalyze a data set in many different ways, or perhaps reanalyze with additional replicates, until you get the result you want; 2) overemphasis on P values rather than on the actual size of the observed effect; 3) overuse of statistical hypothesis testing, and being seduced by the word “significant”; and 4) over-reliance on standard errors, which are often misunderstood. 5) You Do Not Need to Report the Details" Suggestions: "clearly state whether the sample size was chosen in advance, and whether every step used to process and analyze the data was planned as part of the experimental protocol. If you use any form of P-hacking, label the conclusions as “preliminary.”", "Always show and emphasize the effect size (as difference, percent difference, ratio, or correlation coefficient) along with its confidence interval. Consider omitting the reporting of P values.", "If you want to display the variability among the values, show raw data (which is not done often enough, in my opinion). If showing the raw data would make the graph hard to read, show instead a box-whisker plot, a frequency distribution, or the mean and S.D." and "The methods section of every paper should report the methods with enough detail that someone else could reproduce your work. This applies to statistical methods just as it does to experimental methods."
