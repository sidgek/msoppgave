- Clarify that experimental and theoretical papers are separated
- Ranking of methods, not precision&recall/accuracy: how are new results presented
- Dataset size not that important
- Paul Cohen -> self evaluation (late 80's)
- HW is part of documentation
- Support the claims made, not necessarily the method
- Shown generality?
- Point that reproductions are undervalued as papers
- Hypothesis that years differ -> margin of error if subsamples is not

- Computational Repro.: State of the art, challenges, database research opportunities. Freire, Bonnet, Sasha
