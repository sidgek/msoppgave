# What is reproducibility?
- Reproducibility in cancer biology: Making sense of replications https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e23383 What is replication? What does it mean to repeat the methodology? What qualifies as the "same" results? Conclusion: "Replication is a core value of science, and the credibility of scientific claims is based on their reproducibility rather than the authority of their originators. As part of the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology the results of all the Replication Studies will be combined to gain insight into the factors that lead to irreproducible results and the opportunities for improving reproducibility (Errington et al., 2014). The results of the first set of Replication Studies suggest that there is a substantial opportunity to improve reproducibility in cancer biology: the challenge facing all of us is to identify how best to achieve this goal."
