## Reproducibility projects
- Reproducibility Project: Psychology https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/ Replicates 100 experimental and correlational studies from three psychology journals. Originally 97% had significant results, 36% of replications had significant results. If no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with significant effects. Summary Report: http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/349/6251/aac4716?ijkey=1xgFoCnpLswpk&keytype=ref&siteid=sci
- Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/ independently replicating a subset of experimental results from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology studies published between 2010-2012. Currently 5 published replication studies (24.03.2017)
